Program Info:

Abstract:
 - cryptoBalance will allow users to enter their crypto assets and it will return the balance of their
assets by comparing the current value of the assets compared to the initial value of the assets.

Some features of this program:
 - repeatedly asks user to enter a cryptocurrency until user enters "quit" or requests the balance of assets
 - if user enters "find balance" when prompted for another crypto, the balance of the portfolio will be printed
 - after inputting information for each crypto asset, a dictionary of the cryptocurrency (dictionary keys) and gains/losses(dictionary values) will be printed out

Sample inputs for cryptoBalance:
 - cryptoBalance: "Welcome to cryptoBalance! Please enter a cryptocurrency:"
  - User: "bitcoin"
 - cryptoBalance: "At what price in USD did you purchase this cryptocurrency?"
  - User: "2567.80"
 - cryptoBalance: "How many coin did you purchase?"
  - User: "1.4"
 - cryptoBalance: "Please enter a cryptocurrency:"
  - User: "find balance" ––– this will return the value of your cryptocurrency assets and terminate the program

Notes:
 - do not enter any spaces before your inputs
 - you need not use quotation marks when inputing data
 - you do not need to input "$" when asked for price – only the numerical value
 - if you purchased less than one coin, input the amount using a decimal
 - cryptocurrency inputs are not case sensitive ("litecoin" = "LITECOIN" = "Litecoin")
 - entering an invalid input will terminate the program

Notes for grader:
 - Professor Oney said I do not need a cache file in my program because the info provided without one will be more accurate/up to date. The code for the cache file is still there, but I used it only for tests.
